# 09 - Synchronization

To synchronize your notes, you can use an external data directory via `Settings -> Data Directory` and then use any other Sync-App to sync your notes.

Personally I recommend [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).

## Note

Noteless offered WebDav synchronisation in the past via `Settings -> Sync -> WebDav Sync`, but this method is no longer supported because it isn't very stable and I don't know how to fix it. If you want to help out, feel free to [do it](https://github.com/redsolver/noteless)
